                    <p>
                        Beside coding and teaching, Iâ€™m passionate about East
                        Asia. I lived in Taipei for a year, and in Beijing for 6
                        months, where I learned to speak Chinese (å¤§å®¶å¥½ ðŸ‘‹).
                        Iâ€™m weird, but I definitely prefer the traditional
                        characters. Since then, I take every opportuniy to stay
                        connected to this part of the world - travelling there,
                        eating asian food (/ bubble tea ðŸ’œ), watching taiwanese,
                        korean or japanese movies, and reading books that send
                        me back there.
