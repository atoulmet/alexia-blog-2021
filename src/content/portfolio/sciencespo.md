For two semesters now, I have been teaching my **own coding class at Sciences Po Paris** for masters students. I created a JavaScript curriculum aimed to understand the basis of programming: variables, loops, functions, conditions. Later during the semester, students learn web development - HTML, CSS and frontend JS.
